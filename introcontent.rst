:ref:`Part 1: Numpy and Matplotlib <intronumpy>`
==================================================================

Python is a fantastic programming tool. It has a simple syntax, a lot of additional libraries and this scripts are running out of the box. 
All you need is an installed Python interpreter and the used libraries. It is running under MS Windows, Mac, Linux and other. The scripting language 
is like the glue between different components and other programming languages. For example you can call C/C++ functions with Cython inside Python scripts. 

Python claims to combine "remarkable power with very clear syntax" [Python-docs]

In this blog I want to show you some important tools and libraries. This is the first part of this topic. Here is is a introduction by example in the 2 packages.

*  Numpy
*  Matplotlib

Calculation examples with visualization you can find in the project part ( project 1 and 2) .

:ref:`Part 2: Scipy <introscipy>`
===================================================

In this part I want to write something about SciPy. It is an extension for Numpy.

SciPy contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, ODE solvers and others.

Here I want to show you an example with B-splines. It is a subfield of numerical analysis. It has a wide range of applications like in the computer science subfields computer-aided design and computer graphics. It is also used for motion planning of robots and other mechanic structures. 

B-splines were investigated in the beginning of the last century by Nikolai Lobachevsky.  In the mathematics a spline is a smooth polynomial function that is piecewise-defined, and possesses a high degree of smoothness at the places where the polynomial pieces connect (which are known as knots).

B-splines can be evaluated in a numerically stable way by the de Boor algorithm.  I don't want to treat you here with this stuff of mathematical derivations. If you are more interested in this, you can read detailed information about computed geometry here. The details are also  for me not of interest.

In SciPy is a function implemented to solve this stuff for you.

:ref:`Part 3: Sympy <introsympy>`
===================================================


SymPy is a library for symbolic computation for (you are right...) Python.

It includes features like basic symbolic arithmetic, calculus, algebra and discrete mathematics.To show you a small example, 
I used a classical linear system of an one-dimensional movement of a mass  described with the Newtonâ€™s laws of motion which is 
moving vertical between 2 walls, a spring and a damper. :ref:`Read more ... <introsympy>`



:ref:`Part 4: Cython <introcython>`
=====================================================


With Cython you are able to write C and C++ modules for Python. It implements a superset of the Python language. 
With Cython you are also able to call C-functions and realize strong typing of variables and functions like float 
(floating point numbers) or int (integer) definition of variables. Here is an example of strong typing with Cython:

.. code-block:: python

	def primes(int kmax):
    		cdef int n, k, i
    		cdef int p[1000]
    		result = []
    		if kmax > 1000:
			kmax = 1000
   		k = 0
   		n = 2
    		while k < kmax:
        		i = 0
        		while i < k and n % p[i] != 0:
           			 i = i + 1
        		if i == k:
            			p[k] = n
           			 k = k + 1
            			result.append(n)
        		n = n + 1
  		 return result
 
This implementation of an algorithm to find prime numbers has some additional commands instead of the next one, which is implemented in pure Python:

:ref:`Part 5: Psutil <intropsutil>`
===================================================
I wrote a small Python script to be ready for the next Mars invasion. It is running all the time on my server. It checks only some system values like CPU and net usage and the availability of project3001.org. If there is an overload or the address is not available, the program sends an email. This can be a protection against  `DDoS atacks <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack>`_. (Please not me, I'm one of the good guys!!)

  `Psutil <https://code.google.com/p/psutil/>`_  is a small package with very useful system functions.

:ref: `Part 6: Sphinx` <introsphinx>`
====================================


This blog entry is a try to show you some hot tips to improve your work flow with the document generator   `sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_.

The sphinx document generator is very scalable. You are able to improve it with further extensions.

What I want to show you here:

* Generate formulas with the popular latex syntax (png or rendered with mathjax)
* Include line numbers and highlighted lines in your code
* Autodoc, get your documentation directly from the code
* Doctest, integrate your test code in the documentation
* Generate and integrate your plots directly in sphinx by executing your code examples
